### Introduction

For the final project, you will create an **explanatory** data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, and your final deliverable will be a write up along with a Tableau Public workbook.

Now, on to the details!

### Step One - The Data Set

***Data Set***: [Titanic Data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59d54e6d_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv&sa=D&ust=1513630324206000&usg=AFQjCNGPUaSAdmdKHl_sm61h-7wwVSVNcg)

***Overview***: Contains demographics and passenger information from a subset of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. More information about the data set [can be found here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted&sa=D&ust=1513630324207000&usg=AFQjCNGKNugVHanHmk-puQTUsLYDlKNtnQ).

***Notes***: Create a visualization that shows the demographics or passenger information between those passengers who survived and those who died

### Step Two - Get Organized

Eventually you’ll want to submit your project and share it. To do so, you need to create a zip folder that includes the following:

  * **Write-up:** PDF or Markdown file that includes links to your Tableau Public workbooks, published online, and a write-up with four sections.
    * **Summary:** in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it
    * **Design:** explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
    * **Feedback:** include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
    * **Resources:** list any sources you consulted to create your visualization

* **Data Files**
  * the final data set used to create the visualization (usually .csv, .tsv, or .json file)
  * a codebook or other files related to the data set (description, readme, license)

### Step Three - Find a Data Story

Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data! Think about the overall message you want to convey and think about the comparison(s) or relationship(s) you want your readers to see. Remember that you will ultimately need to create a visualization that is explanatory, helping lead a reader to identify one or more key insights into the dataset. Feel free to use whatever visualization and data analysis tools you feel comfortable with using at this point in the process.

### Step Four - Create Your Visualization

First, sketch ideas for your visualization. Once you settle on a sketch, explain any design choices in that sketch, such as chart type, visual encodings, and layout, in the *Design* section of the write-up. Then, create your visualization using Tableau. The visualization must include animation, interaction, or both.

### Step Five - Get Feedback

Share your visualization with **at least one other person** and document their feedback. There are many ways to get feedback, and more feedback is generally better! Here are some options.

* Share your visualization with others in person and have them think aloud as they read and explore the graphic so you can document what stands out to them and how they interpret the graphic.
* Share a link to your project in the Data Analyst Nanodegree Slack and ask others to share constructive criticisms. Be sure to offer advice to others who are seeking feedback too!

You might need to ask specific questions to prompt the reader. Here are some questions to help you. You can, of course, ask others.

* What do you notice in the visualization?
* What questions do you have about the data?
* What relationships do you notice?
* What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
* Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

### Step Six - Document Feedback and Improve the Visualization

For each person that gives you feedback, add the person’s feedback to your write-up file in the *Feedback* section. As you improve and iterate on your visualization, update the visualization **AND** describe any changes in the *Design* section of the write-up.

Your goal is to build evidence that you have shared your visualization, received feedback, and responded to that feedback.

**You need to submit an initial version of your data visualization and the final version with the corresponding write-up.**
